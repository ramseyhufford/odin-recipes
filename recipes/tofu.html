            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>Crispy Baked Tofu</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 block of extra firm tofu (pressed or frozen if possible)</li>
            <li>1.5 Tablespoon Cornstarch</li>
            <li>1.5 Tablespoon Tamari or Soy Sauce</li>           
            <li>Thyme, Garlic, season to taste</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon high heat oil</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Peanut Sauce</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp tamari</li>
            <li>1 tbsp maple syrup</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp sriracha or chili oil, add more or less to taste</li>
            <li>Juice and zest of 1 lime</li>
            <li>1 tsp sesame oil, optional</li>
            <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>3 tbsp water</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425F. Cube your pressed tofu and place in an airtight container with the cornstarch, tamari, oil, thyme and garlic. Seal the container and give it a few gentle shakes until the tofu is evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Place the seasoned tofu on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Flip the tofu and then bake for an additional 8 minutes or until the tofu is crisp and golden.</li>
            <li>While the tofu bakes, make the peanut sauce. In a small bowl, add the peanut butter, tamari, syrup, sriracha, lime juice and zest, sesame oil and seasonings. Give it a whisk until it starts to thicken then slowly whisk in the water a tablespoon at a time until it becomes a creamy sauce. Use this time to also thaw your edamame and prepare your rice/quinoa.</li>
            <li>Place the tofu in a bowl or storage container and pour over the peanut sauce. Fold the tofu into the sauce until fully coated.</li>
            <li>Serve the tofu how you wish. I placed mine over a bowl of rice, edamame, and cucumbers. Then top with scallions and sesame seeds and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
